# Challenge One: Horiseon Standardized Accessibility

## Project Description

For this challenge, the HTML and CSS code was refactored to be made more accessible. Webpage accessibilty is especially important for people with disabilities, who may require assitive technologies (i.e., screen readers), to perceive and navigate webpages. Having an accessible website is essential for organizations as well. A website that is accessible to all will rank higher for search engines than one that is less accessible. Lastly, the refactored code must be logically structured and with its functionality outlined in both the HTML and CSS Code.
